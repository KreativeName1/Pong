# Pong (C# WPF)

## Description
A simple Pong game made in C# using WPF. There are two paddles, one controlled by the player and the other by the computer. The goal is to hit the ball with the paddle and make the ball go past the opponent's paddle. After each point, the ball will reset to the center of the screen and move in a random direction. The speed of the ball will increase after each point scored.

## Features
- Score tracking.
- Pause functionality.
- Settings menu to change different values like paddle speed, ball speed, etc.
- Computer AI to play against.

## Controls
- Use W or Arrow Up to move the paddle up.
- Use S or Arrow Down to move the paddle down.
- Use ESC to pause the game.

## Planned Features
- Start menu
- Local multiplayer
- Highscore tracking
- Sound effects
- Different game modes (maybe)
- Online multiplayer (maybe)

## Known Issues
- The ball sometimes gets stuck in the paddle, causing it to bounce around in weird ways. Happens mostly when the paddle hits the ball at the top/bottom edge or corners.
- If the ball is to fast, it can go through the paddle.
