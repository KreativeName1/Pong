# Pong (C# WPF)

## Description
A simple Pong game made in C# using WPF. There are two paddles, one controlled by the player and the other by the computer. The goal is to hit the ball with the paddle and make the ball go past the opponent's paddle. After each point, the ball will reset to the center of the screen and move in a random direction. The speed of the ball will increase after each point scored.
